## Setup

After cloning, run `npm install`

## Development server

Run `npm run start` to spin front end code,

Run `npm run post-dev` to start the Node server in development mode

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 

You can now seamlessly watch your changes reflect in realtime everytime you hit save (Client + Server code).

## Production Build

Run `npm run build:prerender`

Then `npm run serve:ssr` to start the server

This spins up a prerendered Node server on http://localhost:3015
