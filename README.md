Compiles the boiler application and spins up a Node Express to serve the Boiler Universal application on http://localhost:3015

`npm run build:prerender && npm run serve:prerender` - Compiles your application and prerenders your application's files, spinning up a demo http-server so you can view it on http://localhost:8080 Note: To deploy your static site to a static hosting platform you will have to deploy the dist/browser folder, rather than the usual dist
